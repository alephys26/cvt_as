_Yash Shrivastava, B21CS079_  
_Anshu Raj, B21AI048_  
_Manan Jain, B21AI021_  
_Yash Mangal, B21AI047_  

The **main** branch is secured and no commits can be pushed to it without raising a Pull Request which is also approved by anyone of the collaborators. So create a new branch for any new task and raise a PR for it and wait for approval.

### Branch Name Instructions
When creating a new branch name it in the form: "Bx__Task", where x is 1 for Yash, 2 for Anshu, 3 for Manan, 4 for Mangal.  
For example,  
Yash creates a branch for readme filling through which this readme is created, then the branch is named "B1__Initial_Readme_Updates".  
As a good practice, remember to keep two underscores after _Bx_ and single underscore for each word in task as shown in above example.  
So, the command for creating the branch will be of the form  
`git branch "Bx_Task"`  
To switch to this branch, use  
`git checkout "Bx_Task"`  
To push this branch, use  
`git push origin HEAD` or `git push origin "Bx_Task"`    

### Commit Message Instructions  
The commits should have a message of the form "Bx__Task: Description" where _Description_ is in  
1. Past Tense and Imperative Mood
2. Tells what eactly has been done in the commit  
For example, this readme has got these instructions filled in this commit, then the commit message is "B1__Inital_ReadMe_Updates: ReadMe has Instructions"
